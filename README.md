- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RGVGreatCoder and, ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently researching and learning on the most practical and affordable way to setup an Object Detection system that can process 25+ FPS detecting no more than 10 objects per frame. 
Current edge devices I am testing are a Raspberry Pi 4 + Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 VPU (NCS2). 
So far I've been able to setup the NCS2 toolkit but pending is setting up the rest to run my models by inference in the NCS2.
If you have any tips and links you can share, you are welcome to do so.
... Thank you.
